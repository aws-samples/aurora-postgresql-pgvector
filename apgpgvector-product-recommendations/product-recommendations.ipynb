    "Semantic search is a type of search technique that aims to understand the intent and context of a user's query, rather than simply matching keywords or phrases. It goes beyond traditional keyword-based search by considering the meaning of words, the relationships between them, and the overall context of the query to deliver more relevant search results. Semantic search is important because it can help users to find the information they are looking for more quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of how semantic search is used today:\n",
    "- Amazon uses semantic search to help customers find the products they are looking for. For example, if you search for \"blue running shoes,\" Amazon will return results for shoes that are both blue and designed for running, even if you didn't use both of those keywords in your query.\n",
    "- Netflix uses semantic search to recommend movies and TV shows to its users. For example, if you watch a lot of documentaries, Netflix will recommend other documentaries that you may be interested in.\n",
    "- Google uses semantic search to improve the relevance of its search results. For example, if you search for \"capital of France,\" Google will return results for Paris, even though you didn't explicitly mention Paris in your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build the core components of a textually similar Products. Often people don't know what exactly they are looking for and in that case they just type an item description and hope it will retrieve similar items. Othertimes, they have a photo of a product and looking for similar products matching those items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build the core components of a textually similar Products. Often people don't know what exactly they are looking for and in that case they just type an item description and hope it will retrieve similar items. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core components of searching textually similar items is a fixed length sentence/word embedding i.e. a  “feature vector” that corresponds to that text. The reference word/sentence embedding typically are generated offline and must be stored so they can be efficiently searched. In this use case we are using a pretrained SentenceTransformer model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). \n",
    " \n",
    "To enable efficient searches for textually similar items, we'll use [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to generate fixed length sentence embeddings i.e “feature vectors” and use the Nearest Neighbor search in Amazon Aurora for PostgreSQL using the extension [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector). The PostgreSQL `pgvector` extension lets you store and search for points in vector space and find the \"nearest neighbors\" for those points. Use cases include recommendations (for example, an \"other songs you might like\" feature in a music application), image recognition, and fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps we'll follow to build textually similar items: \n",
    "- Generate feature vectors for the products description from kaggle dataset using HuggingFace SentenceTransformer. \n",
    "- Store the generated vectors in Amazon Aurora for PostgreSQL as vector datatype along with the metadata \n",
    "- Explore some sample text queries, and visualize the results.\n",

It supports exact and approximate nearest neighbor search, L2 distance, inner product, and cosine distance.\n",
