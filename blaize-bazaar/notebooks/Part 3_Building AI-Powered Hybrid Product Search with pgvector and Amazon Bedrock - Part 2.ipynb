    "# Part 3: Building AI-Powered Hybrid Product Search with pgvector and Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "### Building and Validating Hybrid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Part 3 of our workshop on building an AI-powered hybrid search system. In this section, we'll bring together Amazon Bedrock's embedding capabilities and Aurora PostgreSQL's pgvector extension to create a powerful, context-aware product search engine. The hybrid search implementation combines semantic search (vector-based) with keyword search (traditional text matching) to get the best of both worlds. It retrieves documents that are both semantically relevant and contain exact or similar keywords, improving precision and recall.\n",

    "## Hybrid Search Implementation\n",
    "Our implementation brings together several key components to create an intuitive search experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Generation**: We use Amazon Bedrock's Titan model to convert text queries into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. These embeddings allow us to find products based on contextual similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vector Similarity Search**: Using pgvector's specialized operators, we can efficiently find the closest matching products in our database. The `<=>` operator computes cosine similarity between vectors, helping us rank results by relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Keyword Based Search**: Using PostgreSQL full-text search method to find the exact match for the product description.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieval and reranking**: The combined result from semantic and keyword based search is returned based on the query. The results are then reranked using Cohere re-ranking model to prioritize the most relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interactive Interface**: We've created a user-friendly interface with both basic and advanced search capabilities:\n",
    "   - Basic Search: Simple query input with adjustable number of results\n",
    "   - Advanced Search: Additional filters for price, ratings, and categories\n",
    "   - Example Queries: Quick-access buttons to demonstrate various search scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "Our search interface combines several sophisticated features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dual Search Modes**:\n",
    "   - Basic mode for quick, straightforward searches\n",
    "   - Advanced mode with filters for refined product discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-time Feedback**:\n",
    "   - Loading indicators during searches\n",
    "   - Clear result displays with product details\n",
    "   - Similarity scores to show match relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced User Experience**:\n",
    "   - Hover effects on product cards\n",
    "   - Star ratings visualization\n",
    "   - Price and category highlighting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results Display\n",
    "The search results are presented in an easy-to-scan format, with each product card showing:\n",
    "- Product image and description\n",
    "- Price and rating information\n",
    "- Number of reviews\n",
    "- Category classification\n",
    "- Semantic match score\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface updates dynamically as users:\n",
    "- Switch between basic and advanced search\n",
    "- Adjust filter parameters\n",
    "- Try different example queries\n",
    "- Explore search results"
