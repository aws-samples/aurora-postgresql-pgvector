    "Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. No prior machine learning experience is required. This example will walk you through the process of integrating Aurora with the Comprehend Sentiment Analysis API and making sentiment analysis inferences via SQL commands. For our example, we have used a sample dataset for fictitious hotel reviews. We use a pretrained SentenceTransformer model `all-mpnet-base-v2` from [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) for generating vector embeddings and store vector embeddings in our Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster with pgvector. The sentiment analysis part of this demo will be done via psql, a popular PostgreSQL client in a hosted AWS Cloud9 terminal environment."
